    "bio":"I am a Front-end Developer with few months of professional experience. I build successful websites and web-apps that are fast, easy to use, and coded with the same eye for detail as a designer. I started coding from the August 2019 after completing my engineering. I have serious passion for modern looking websites with a little bit of animations. I use the modern frameworks such as React to design the website you want. I will write the code and get it perfect until you have the exact website you want ! If you have an application idea in mind and looking for a front-end developer to create magic and to convert your idea into a beautiful website then you are at the right place.",
